# wisdom-summit-2021
Repository of pre-summit survey files and analyses documents for the 2021 International Wisdom Summit. 

In August-September 2021, we asked scholars in psychology, moral philosophy, education, and cognitive science to fill out a 10-min survey, with an aim to identify points 
of convergence and disagreement with respect to the relationship between wisdom, morality, and culture. By identifying points of convergence as well as identifying core 
themes where scholars disagree, we aimed to facilitate a conversation on these topics, sharpen definitions and enable productive discussion between these evolving fields.

This repository stores the original survey, codebook for open-ended responses along with coded responses (by sets of two independent raters for morality and culture, respectively), survey responses, and a reproducible analytic code in R.
