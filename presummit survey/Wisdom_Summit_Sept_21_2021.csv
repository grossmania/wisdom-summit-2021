For example the perception of blood as ""unclean"" in jewish and islamic contexts evolved from a lack of understanding of germ theory that was balanced with a concept of purity.  This extends to the role of animals and food choices such as pigs.  During early civilization, humans didn't understand that the animal should have been washed before breaking the skin barrier in butchering (also consider lack of water in desert settings).  In Afghanistan among the Pashtun culture, there I a story of a man who had a pig run into his home and people were trying to capture it.  The homeowner said that the pig, undesirable as it was should be considered a guest which invoked the higher order moral values of pashtunwali (loosely translated to hospitality in this case).  As a guest, the homeowner was obligated to provide asylum for the animal even if it cost him his own life.  You can see this value play out in today's culture with a story of US Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell who has his entire team killed and made his way into an Afghan home and invoked the same value to encourage them to provide for his safety until he could escape.

The question is what underlies this choice across time and situation? What props up these decisions? If it is programming, what constitutes effective programming that is difficult to undo? Can original programming be undone? If so, how?; Morality may also be a odds game. Certain circumstances can sway one this way and that, and our (biological, social, and psychological) programming can change the odds and interact with the particular set of circumstances dealt.; A much more interesting question is if wisdom can be chosen, whether those who are not born naturally aware can be trained to absorb the information and motivated to want to do so themselves.; Can two opposing views both be wise? What is the definition of wise? Perhaps one could argue that a person needs to want the moral in order to want to be wise. What motivates people to want wisdom? What benefits do wisdom bestow? I find this a much more philosophical question than a psychological one. Philosophy emphasizes a way of living and choice. Is philosophy a luxury item? Is psychology more basic in that we look at the elements that promote the ability to choose wisdom and morality?

And it has to do with how much the culture encourages mindfulness and awareness (not just of self, but of others and the circumstances). To translate into language used in the common wisdom model, this would be how much culture affects the epistemological humility and ability to hold several perspectives. But culture is not a singular entity (even when limited to one population). It’s a full rounded thing where it influences a part of a population to be one certain way and fails to move another part of a population because the culture also consists of opposing or differing parts. Culture can also influence how we think about this inherent difference between people, between groups of people, and even differing parts within the self. But it’s complex because culture is dynamic and constantly changed by the people in it, who are influenced by it. That two way effect makes it feel like we are talking about quicksand and trying to define that which is constantly morphing.

In my opinion, this is not wisdom. There must be an aspect of morality - an understanding and active behavior of how to interact with and treat others in a mindful and selfless manner in order for one to ""have"" wisdom, or to ""be"" wise;  * Cultural morality may differ according to certain populations, however the basic moral construction of humans (right vs wrong; good vs bad behavior) defines us as humans.  Ethical judgements based on culture, upbringing, and education may influence these basic moral constructions, thus influence the degree to which one ""has"" wisdom;  *  To the above point, are there degrees of wisdom?  Can one ""be wise"" in certain areas of expertise, but ""be unwise"" in other areas of life?  Does this rely on the level of morality one has, and can one's level of morality determine ""how wise"" an individual is or becomes?","It would seem that reflectivity is necessary for facilitating moral intentions and/or actions, because without first being able to reflect on one's life experiences (particularly those that have been difficult), and gaining some insight or lesson from those experiences, it would be challenging to act or to think in a wise manner in similar situations - for oneself or on behalf of others.

In some cases we learn to push against the master narrative and how to do so effectively in ways that foster self and/or social improvement. In other cases we learn to conform or use the ways of making-meaning to self and/or social improvement;   •	Overall, cultural systems may be like the equipment available to us in a gym that allow us to get stronger, more flexible, etc. But, because culture shapes people and people shape culture, our use of the equipment to particular ends can and should change the equipment.

That human beings rely on religion and spirituality as an experiential foundation to Wisdom and morality is an EMPIRICAL fact!;    • Judeo-Christianity, for example, is, properly understood, a 3000 year-old *technology* for development of Wisdom and morality. That this tradition has been effectively ostracized from modern universities is an obvious fact -- and just as obvious is that this exclusion violates some of the central premises of empiricism, namely objectivity and willingness to consider all relevant data and literature;  • It is equally unscientific to denigrate poetry and Scripture as essential cultural repositories of Wisdom. One chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, for example, is more valuable to the pursuit of Wisdom than all the work of all so-called empirical scientists.   • Scientific fundamentalism -- the belief that science alone, without consideration of religion, philosophy and art, can procure a thorough understanding of Wisdom and morality -- is no better than religious fundamentalism;    • Modern ""empirical"" wisdom research is a classic case of groupthink: it selects as authorities only those who share a limited set of views, without, as far as I can see, making even a faint effort to consider other perspectives. I have a background in empirical science myself, and believe that this is generally considered a bad way to do science.  Rather, the good scientist goes out of his or her way to (1) admit ones proneness to self-deception and (2) solicit precisely those views one feels inclined to ignore.  • It is absurd for modern psychologists to be ignorant of Plato -- yet that is the case, since Plato is hardly if ever taught in psychology programs. ","I disagree that intentions must be defined in terms of outcomes. A classical view is that there is an affective ""intention to goodness.""  That is, the classical view is that morality consists mainly (or begins with) an intention to do ""good"" or to ""be righteous.""  Again, see Plato (or else Iris Murdoch).

Without virtue, there is no wisdom, only cleverness.  Virtue in the Aristotelian sense extends beyond morality. By that I mean that morality is essentially about choosing the right action according to principles of justice, fairness, honesty etc.   However, virtue extends beyond this to place at the core eudaimonia.  Eudaimonia is essentially social, not individualistic: morality is often concerned with individual choice about right and wrong in specific instances.  Eudaimonia is concerned with ""human flourishing"", which extends beyond what is right or wrong according to principles of morality.   Human flourishing is other directed and moves the temporal landscape to enhancing the future condition of humankind. This is especially important in relation to environmental care (including global warming). It is also consistent with the human generativity impulse.       ","My approach to wisdom has always been Social Practice Wisdom, although if we incorporate eudaimonia as a fundamental of wisdom then ""social practice' becomes redundant.  So yes, moral intentions and actions are fundamental to wisdom. That is, our actions must be guided by ennobling and humane desires and beliefs that are founded not just on reason and fact, but in domains where reason and fact are hard to apply, are based on what ""should be"" the case.  Wisdom is not wisdom unless enacted. If we applied Theory of Planned Behaviour then an intention to act in the right manner is insufficient. There must be the discipline of conation to move beyond intention to action.   ",Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,
