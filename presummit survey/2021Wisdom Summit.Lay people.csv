For the most part this is dictated by the dominant religion, regardless of the individuals religious beliefs, as we go through multiple phases in life of trying to fit in with the social dynamic.That dynamic temporarily defines our fashion, entertainment and hobby preferences, but at a more permanent level it defines our morals and ethics -this can be seen in our political opinions when compared to the religious community we grew up in. Even in atheist families its difficult to separate ourselves from religious influences. If we look at gypsy/traveller communities that have very minimal focus on religion on a day-to-day basis, theft and violence is seen as more acceptable based on the morality of providing for and protecting the family/community -from an outsiders viewpoint it is barbaric and many activities should be illegal, but within the community the same acts are seen as a point of pride or for a necessary cause so completely justified.
As far as wisdom in relation to morality, wisdom is the culmination of our life experiences determining how we move forward whereas morality is a preset standard that is supposed to guide us when we have no experience in the matter. Where they crossover is when we experience a moral dilemma and suddenly come to terms with our true beliefs; accept what we have learned from society or defy our lessons in order to do what our gut instinct believes to be correct -wisdom overrides our morality only when our opinion changes due to that defiance. Many grow up being told being gay is a sin, an astonishing amount of antigay politicians and activists have also been revealed as engaging in gay sex/relationships themselves -this shows that wisdom can also be defied by choosing moral principle as infalliable (though it is fair to point out that this could be related to the earlier point of wanting to fit in with our community, even if its only for personal gain, eg not wanting to lose our career).
